Summary of the Code
The code you provided implements a user registration and login interface for a website called EduAidHub. The setup includes both front-end HTML/CSS for the forms and back-end PHP code for handling user registration and login, connecting to a MySQL database to store user information securely. Key points include:
1. HTML/CSS Layout:
o The sign-up and sign-in forms are created using HTML with placeholders, labels, and font icons for a polished look.
o JavaScript enables form toggling between the sign-up and sign-in forms for a seamless user experience.
o CSS styles add modern visuals, transitions, and responsive design, enhancing the form's usability and aesthetic appeal.
2. PHP Backend Logic:
o Database Connection: PHP code connects to a MySQL database (eduaid) to store and retrieve user data.
o Sign-Up Process: When users submit the sign-up form, PHP validates that the email is unique and then hashes the password (using MD5) before storing it in the users table.
o Sign-In Process: The code verifies the user credentials against the database. If the login is successful, the session is started, and the user is redirected to the homepage.
o Session Management: For security, session handling is integrated to store user login status and allow safe navigation on the website.
